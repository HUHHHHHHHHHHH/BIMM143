# PBD Statistics

```{r}
data <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
head(data)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
#create a function with X as an imput
sum_comma <- function(data) {
  #Substitute comma and convert to numeric 
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", data))) 
}

```

For X Ray

```{r}
round(sum_comma(data$X.ray)/sum_comma(data$Total), 3)*100

```

For EM

```{r}
round(sum_comma(data$EM)/sum_comma(data$Total), 3)*100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(sum_comma(data$Total[1])/sum_comma(data$Total), 3)*100
```

> Q3: Insert your HIV image.

![HIV-PR structure from MERK with critical residues highlighted. Protein structure is color coded to residue.](1HSG.png)


> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Hydrogen molecules are too small and abundant to be efficiently displayed

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

The water molecule binds to to ASP25 on each chain




#Working with Structures in R 


```{r}
library(bio3d)
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

There are 190 residues. 


> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

Water (shown as HOH)


> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

There are 2 chains. 


# Predicting Movements of a Structure 

First, read the ADK structure

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```


Perform a prediction of flexibility with a technique called NMA (normal mode analysis), which is meant to predict flexibility and motion.

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```


Write out a "movie" (trajectory) of the motion for viewing in MOlstar

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
